    <h1>Web Workers in JavaScript-From Start to Advanced</h1>
    <p>The Problem Web Workers Solve</p>
    <p>JavaScript is single-threaded (it runs on one main thread â†’ the UI thread).
        ðŸ‘‰ If you run heavy tasks (large loops, image processing, crypto hashing, etc.) on the main thread, your UI
        freezes.</p>

        Web Workers = run JavaScript in background threads (separate from the main UI thread).</p>
    <p>They donâ€™t block the UI.</p>
    <p>They communicate via messages (postMessage & onmessage).</p>
    <p>They canâ€™t directly access DOM (sandboxed environment).</p>
    <h1>Types of Web Workers</h1>
    <p>(1.) Dedicated Worker â€“ tied to a single script; one-to-one with main thread.</p>
    <p>(2.) Shared Worker â€“ can be shared across multiple scripts/tabs/origins.</p>
    <p>(3.) Service Worker â€“ proxy layer between app & network (used in PWA, caching, push notifications).</p>
